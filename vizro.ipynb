    "            The project aims to create a dashboard to aid in the evaluation of wind potential at a particular site. \n",
    "            The first step in that evaluation is the estimation of theoretical potential, which is the maximum wind\n",

    "            If desired so, this dashboard can be theoretically applied to any individual wind site, discounting its \n",
